# A guide to ecofriendly CryptoArt (NFTs)

## Introduction
*This article is not a comprehensive “CryptoArt for beginners”. It’s more of a very brief (as possible) **first step** towards a guide for the adventurous artist who wants to create and sell CryptoArtworks (or NFTs) on the blockchain - **on sustainable platforms**. Since the field is moving so rapidly, the information below is likely to go out of date very quickly. We will try to keep it up to date via [pull-requests](https://github.com/memo/eco-nft/pulls) and [issues](https://github.com/memo/eco-nft/issues). And I **hope the platforms themselves will add relevant information, “Statement of Values”, and roadmaps to their own site**.*

---

The CryptoArt NFT Market (i.e. selling digital art on the blockchain) is worth at least $150M - and this excludes some of the largest marketplaces like [opensea.io](http://opensea.io), (and this figure is quite heavily skewed of course, with the top artists earning the most [[1](https://cryptoart.io/artists)]).

Selling work on a blockchain can be a technically challenging task. For this reason, many platforms and websites have emerged, aiming to make this process as seamless and easy as possible for artists. Unfortunately, currently many of these websites are based on the Ethereum blockchain, which is very inefficient and ecologically costly by design. E.g. selling just a single-edition artwork on Ethereum has a carbon footprint starting at around 100 KgCO2, which is equivalent to a 1 hour flight (and depending on the platform, can reach a long-haul flight) [[2](https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053)]. Selling an edition of 100 works has a carbon footprint of over 10 tonnes CO2, which is more than the per capita annual footprint of someone in the EU - including all emissions from industry and trade [[3](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#co2-embedded-in-trade)].

But there are more sustainable routes emerging. As the CryptoArt NFT market is exploding in a gold-rush style free-for-all, there is a lack of clear information on the ecological impact of different approaches to NFTs. The purpose of this guide is to help CryptoArtists who are interested in exploring more sustainable alternatives. Currently, these more sustainable platforms do not have the volume of their unsustainable counterparts (i.e. the Ethereum-based platforms). For this reason, collectors and sales are likely to be significantly lower too on the more sustainable alternatives. However, hopefully as more artists migrate to these emerging waters, this can encourage platforms, developers, investors and collectors, to bridge to develop more **ecologically friendly and transparent platforms**.


**We are also hoping the platforms themselves will be more transparent on the matter, and we can eventually retire this document**. However, at the time of writing, not a single platform has publicly acknowledged the issue on their website. When they do, the relevant links will be included below.


**What would be great to see from CryptoArt / NFT platforms regarding sustainability**:
- A statement of values
- A commitment to transparency, communication and guidance for CryptoArtists
- A roadmap (other than “We hope ETH2 will resolve the issue when it’s released in a year or two" - e.g. alternate chains, side chains, lazy minting, layer 2 scaling which are currently in the process of supporting. Including bounties to PoS chains and wallets to create a solution to PoW etc)
- A donation of proceeds to carbon credits or to subsidize the ecological footprint and their direct environmental impact

## Glossary
The purpose of this section is to introduce concepts in an incredibly brief (1-2 sentences each) manner. For more information please follow the links.

- **Blockchain**: A decentralized database. The technicalities of this are not relevant for our discussion. What is important to know however, is that there are many different blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Algorand, Polkadot etc), and usually, each blockchain has its own (crypto)currency.
- **Cryptocurrency**: Magic internet money. Bitcoin (BTC) is the most well known cryptocurrency and the oldest. Ethereum (ETH) is another well known cryptocurrency (and the basis for most current CryptoArt platforms). There are thousands of other cryptocurrencies (typically small volume cryptocurrencies are collectively known as **altcoins**).
- **CryptoArt**: Art registered on the blockchain. I.e. Media is associated with an **NFT**.
https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/1/14/what-is-cryptoart
- **NFT**: Non-Fungible Token. A unique token (i.e. long number or string) that is associated with some media (e.g. image, video, poem, whatever) or any unique asset, such as a house, property etc which has its ID or file registered specifically to one block on the blockchain.
Detailed description: https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens
- **Smart Contract**: A fancy way of saying “a program that lives and runs on the blockchain”. Smart contracts are what creates and keeps track of NFTs, ASAs, Dapps etc. Some of these types of contracts can be legally binding.
- **Minting an NFT**: The act of ‘creating’ an NFT, i.e. registering the token on the blockchain, and associating it with your media (e.g. file).
- **NFT Platform / Marketplace**: A website which allows people to buy & sell NFTs. Think ebay or Amazon, except it uses a blockchain in the background. Different platforms can:
    - use different blockchains (though currently nearly all of them use Ethereum)
    - use different approaches to accepting artists. e.g.:
        - anyone can register immediately
        - anyone can apply, but applicants are manually accepted (or not - and some are more selective than others)
        - invite only
    - **NFT Minting only** (website uses its own smart-contract) vs **NFT Factory** (allows artist to own smart-contract, this can allow artist more control)
    - Compatible with other platforms (e.g. list the same work on multiple platforms)
- **Gas fee**: A fee one must pay (usually paid by the seller, i.e. artist) to be able to publish, i.e. mint (think ebay listing fee) on Ethereum. This fee goes not to the platform, but to Ethereum to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions. Currently Ethereum gas fees are very high and fluctuate (e.g. >$100-$1000) with network congestion. Some days and times are dramatically less or more due to current on-chain demand. There are some existing and WIP solutions discussed in the next section.
- **Wallet**: A blockchain analog for a bank account on the blockchain, which contains your cryptocurrency. Different cryptocurrencies often require different wallets. Without going into too much detail, usually this is a piece of software, hardware (or browser extension) which gives you a **private seed** - which is typically a bunch of random words, like “red fox banana submarine tutu” (this is like your password for the wallet, which you should keep safe and never share with anyone!) and a corresponding ‘hashed’ version (e.g. 17ah2k25djhsa7974) which is your public facing **wallet address** (like an IBAN, so it’s what you share with others to get paid or trade).
- **Consensus Algorithm**: The algorithm that underlies the blockchain. Details of this are irrelevant for this guide, except to say that Proof-of-Work (PoW) is the consensus algorithm that is hundreds of times more inefficient than the other ones (deliberately so), and is also the one which is the most common today unfortunately. For familiarity, here are some other consensus algorithms (how they work is not important for now): Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), Proof-of-Authority (PoA), Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT), etc.

## Ways to make it better
Here are just some of the ways to improve the carbon footprint of NFTs:
### Still using Ethereum:
- **Lazy minting**: This is not necessarily dramatically better, around 2x, or maybe 3x less carbon footprint. This is done by not creating an NFT until its first purchase.
- **Sidechains**: NFTs are minted on non-Ethereum PoS sidechains, but can be moved onto Ethereum later. If they are not moved, can be hundreds times more efficient.
- **Bridges**: Are specifically for making one blockchain ecosystem compatible with another blockchain. This can also be referred to as interoperability and allows chains to interact which otherwise cannot. The advantage of this is you can go from ETH to another less impactful chain without loosing the data minted.
- **Various Layer 2 (L2) scaling optimizations**: Can be up to 100x more efficient.

### Using other blockchains:
- Instead of Ethereum, other blockchains are used. This can be up to hundreds of times better for the environment in terms of carbon footprint. Some of these chains include Algorand, Tezos, Polkadot and other PoS networks.

## NFT Platforms & Marketplaces
These are the websites that you would use to upload, ‘mint’ and sell your works.
For sake of simplicity, we can say that from an ecological perspective, Ethereum (which uses PoW), is the worst (unless sidechains or L2 scaling is implemented).

Platforms using different blockchains (e.g. using PoS, PoA etc) will generally be hundreds times more efficient. For those wishing to not incur the immense footprints of Ethereum, look for - and support - alternatives. Sales may be lower for now (see the **Risks** section at the end). This document doesn’t aim to give advice, instead it is a **first step** in collecting this information in one place.

Hopefully if there is enough demand for **sustainable and transparent platforms**, this can encourage developers, investors and collectors to invest in and develop these more ecologically friendly alternatives and grow the market. (And hopefully the community can provide more feedback - perhaps in the [issues](https://github.com/memo/eco-nft/issues)).

## Risks
- Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile [[4](https://coinmarketcap.com/)], and their values can dramatically fall (or rise). E.g. if you sell a NFT for 1 ETH, which is currently worth ~\$1600, the value of ETH could later drop to a few hundred $ in a few months, or even in a few weeks (alternatively, it could rise to two or three thousand $$ too).
- This becomes potentially even more risky (or potentially more rewarding) with cryptocurrencies that have a much smaller market cap (e.g. NEAR, XTZ, AVAX etc), which could die and drop to zero (or go to the moon) in a few weeks.
- Please act responsibly. Seek financial advice if need be (preferably not from YouTube, TikTok, Elon Musk or Chamath Palihapitiya).
- The smaller blockchains are likely to have fewer collectors. So expect smaller sales on these platforms. (Though as more people start to use these blockchains for NFTs the prices will likely rise with demand).
